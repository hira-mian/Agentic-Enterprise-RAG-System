# Evaluation files

| File or folder | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `splits.json` | Which questions are in the development (300), calibration (100), and final (100) splits. Fixed; do not tune on the final split. |
| `corpus_manifest.json` | Record of the exact dataset used: source commit, document counts, and a content fingerprint. Written by `python -m src.data.corpus`. |
| `results/bm25_full_development/` | BM25+ baseline results on the development split |
| `results/dense_full_development/` | BGE-small + FAISS baseline results on the development split |

Each results folder contains `summary.json` (all scores), `predictions.jsonl` (the
top 20 documents per question), and `upstream_answers.jsonl` (the top 10 in the
benchmark's own format).

The data comes from Onyx's
[EnterpriseRAG-Bench](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/EnterpriseRAG-Bench) (MIT).
See the [data card](../docs/DATA_CARD.md) and
[baseline results](../docs/FULL_CORPUS.md).
